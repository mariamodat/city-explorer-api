# city-explorer-api

**Author**: Mariam
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
I will begin building my own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that my server will manage.

## Getting Started
input the name of the city they want to preview its weather.
## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
we used React as the programming library or JS, Express to connect the front end with the backend with some bootstap styling.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

*  completed Create a new repo called city-explorer-api on GitHub, initialized with a README file. Clone it locally, and do all your work on a meaningfully-named feature branch off of main.
* completed Run the command npm init to create a new project. Answer the prompts with reasonable answers, or just hit enter to accept the defaults. Review the package.json file that it creates for you, and edit it if desired.
* Use npm install to add the required dependencies to this project: express, dotenv, and cors.

*  Copy the contents of weather.json and paste it into your (otherwise empty) local /data/weather.json.
